The game should start with the player working as an intern.
So, we'll have a small story up. That's fine to work with.

	+ "\nYou also realise that you need to get your documents and your resume if you want to apply for a job, you rush back in and get your files,"
	+ " and manage to get out with your files and fortunately, some cash lying in the hall. Running from the deadly brunt of the utensils that your mom throws at you,"
	+ " you embark on your own business adventure, pointing at the gods that this shall be your great business story.")

# not exactly sure whether or not, we should take the name of the character, instead of just going with the flow.

# Also, it would be a great implementational idea if we could manage to have a calender show up at the start of each day.
# Kinda showing how the player is progressing.

# Tul's Corp
A text-based game situated in an office, called _Tul's Corp_.


Having been fresh out of college... since the past few years.
You realise that there's no other way to get a job, other than by working your way up.
For now, you just managed to land yourself an internship.

Working with what you have, you need to try to make this a solid source of income.
To feed your kids..
Just kidding, there's no one who wants to marry you.
